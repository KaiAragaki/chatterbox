# chatterbox

`chatterbox` lets you make figures of text messages fairly painlessly.

```{r}
library(chatterbox)
```

A basic conversation is included to get you started:

```{r}
conversation
```

Minimally, all you need to do is supply the data and who you want to be on the right (`me`):

```{r}
file <- knitr::fig_path('.png')
ragg::agg_png(file, width = 1500, height = 700, res = 200)
conversation |>
  chat(me = "Alice")
dev.off()
knitr::include_graphics(file)
```
You can also change the theme (with the `theme` argument -- either "light" or "dark") or make your own (with `make_theme`):

```{r}
fiery <- make_theme(
  text_me = "white",
  text_you = "white",
  fill_me = "#ea7434",
  fill_you = "#c74956",
  bg =  "#f6a50b"
)

file <- knitr::fig_path('.png')
ragg::agg_png(file, width = 1500, height = 700, res = 200)
conversation |>
  chat(me = "Alice", theme = fiery)
dev.off()
knitr::include_graphics(file)
```
